# subtitle-cleaner
Removes blank lines and trims leading and trailing white spaces from srt subtitles.



The script will read an srt subtitle, and remove empty/blank subtitle lines that render the subtitles unusable in many smart media players. In the end, it will save the output in utf-8 encoding.

The encoding of the input subtitle will be autoguessed, or it can be supplied by the user in case the autoguessing fails.
